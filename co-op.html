<p class="card-text">Modern advances in wireless device and sensor technology has accelerated the use of mobile health (mHealth) applications and trackers. Although individual tracking apps offer personalized health experienced, collaborative mHealth systems may offer families with chronically ill adolescents the opportunity to record more holistic representations of individual health. CO-OP is an mHealth solution that enables adolescents with chronic illnesses and their caretakers to collaboratively record patient observations of daily life (ODLs).</p>

<p class="card-text"><b>Affiliations:</b> Georgia Institute of Technology, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University Hospital</p>

<p class="card-text"><b>Funding:</b> NSF #1652302</p>

<p class="card-text"><b>Collaborators:</b> Matthew Hong, Jungwook Park, Kimberly Do, Rosa Arriaga, Sampath Prahalad, Thomas Olson and Lauren Wilcox</p>

<p class="card-text"><b>Role:</b> Digitally transcribed and analyzed 20 patient and parent paper diaries Reviewed and revised over 3000 lines of coded, transcribed interview dialogue to identify significant phrases and corresponding sub-themes using Braun and Clarke's qualitative data analysis recommendations Devised a new comprehensive list of 6 themes (with corresponding sub-themes) extracted from ODL Exit Interview transcriptions Problem Statement: Traditional health trackers place an emphasis on individual logging and do not collect input from informed caregivers and caretakers.</p>

<p class="card-text"><b>Key Skills:</b> Interviews, Qualitative &amp; Quantitative Data Analysis, Data Transcription</p>

<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">2. Research </h5>

<p class="card-text">To familiarize myself with Matthew's research, I thoroughly read several academic papers.</p>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Literature Review</h6>

<p class="card-text">Reading additional academic papers informed me of the key challenges in conducting HCI research in a healthcare setting&mdash;ensuring interview privacy, increasing adolescent engagement, and promoting adolescent &quot;voice&quot; to limit overshadowing parental engagement. I also learned of the collaborative role of caretakers and adolescents in maintaining adolescent health and wellness. Moreover, I also recognized the growing role of technology in personal healthcare and popularity among savvy adolescents. </p>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Competitive Analysis</h6> 

<p class="card-text">Although traditional mHealth apps do not offer a collaborative approach to health tracking, these apps still include caretaker-tracking or self-tracking. These features include mood, symptom, and activity tracking; other apps offer in-app social features, where users may share their daily loggings with friends and families.</p>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Functional Requirements</h6> 

<ol>
<li>Record user's daily symptoms, emotions, and activities (with time, date, location, social contexts)</li>
<li>Offer collaborative health tracking for patients and parents</li>
<li>Convey symptomatic information in an easy-to-understand format</li>
<li>Offer an array of media-rich tools for recording-keeping</li>
<li>Keep a running daily log of patient and parent-entered information </li>
<li>Allow review of previously logged information</li>
</ol>

<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">4. Low Fidelity Prototyping &mdash; Diary Probe</h5>

<p class="card-text">Using a co-design (participatory design) method, we worked with patients to understand the role of technology in patient lives. This helped to inform a diary probe, where patients and parents were given low-fidelity diaries to log their ODLs for two weeks.</p>

<p class="card-text">After the two week diary probe concluded, post-interviews were conducted with all patients and parents and then transcribed for later analysis.</p>

<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">5. Analysis</h5>

<p class="card-text">I heavily participated in qualitative data analysis through analyzing ODL Exit Interviews and Paper Diaries, where I followed Braun and Clarke's qualitative data analysis recommendations in the development and identification of themes for ODL Exit Interview.</p>

<p class="card-text">As part of my thematic data analysis, I devised a comprehensive list of 6 themes (with corresponding sub-themes) extracted from ODL Exit Interview transcriptions and subsequently coded over 3000 lines of transcribed interview dialogue to identify significant phrases and their corresponding sub-themes.</p>

<p class="card-text">In addition to reviewing and analyzing patient and parent interviews, I also analyzed the product of the second phase of the CO-OP study: the ODL patient and parent paper diaries. First, I compiled and digitally transcribed all 10 pairs of patient and parent diaries. I then followed Braun and Clarke's qualitative data analysis recommendations in the development and identification of themes for ODL Exit Interview. And, using the same comprehensive list of 6 themes (with corresponding sub-themes) extracted from ODL Exit Interview transcripts, I coded over 2,000 diary entries to identify significant phrases and their corresponding sub-themes. Then, I ran statistical analysis to better quantitatively understand the results of the paper diaries.</p>

<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">6. Findings</h5>

<p class="card-text">After reading and analyzing all patient and parent data, I derived the following core themes, each with aligning sub-themes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Experience with diary logging practice</li>
<li>How patient families conceptualize everyday illness experience</li>
<li>Preferences for experiencing illness experiences</li>
<li>Perspectives around how family members and clinical experts can collaborate</li>
<li>Preferences to communicate/share information</li>
<li>Managing privacy concerns Challenges [the diary helps to overcome]</li>
</ol>

<p class="card-text">In summary, the diary probe allowed me to derive several findings related to how patients and parents used and valued the diary. For example, families successfully used the diaries collaboratively to record patient-related info which allowed parents to be informed of their child's health and well-being. Moreover, families enjoyed the illustrated stickers and found them easy to use and descriptive. In addition, families frequently utilized media-rich logging techniques such as note-taking, pictures, videos, and voice recording to provide more descriptive health logs.</p>

<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">7. Validation</h5>

<p class="card-text">Positive feedback towards various features in the diary probe study inspired similar features in the high-fidelity prototype. For example, because families found illustrated stickers enjoyable and easy to understand, we incorporated similar illustrations to convey emotion and symptom in the app. While the app collected similar emotional, symptomatic, and activity-based information as its predecessor prototype, it also utilized its technological affordances and integrated live media-rich logging techniques in-app; that is, users could now write notes, take pictures/videos, and sketch drawing from within the app itself. Fortunately, many helpful features from the diary probe were safely preserved in the digital app.</p>

          </br>
<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">9. Usability</h5>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Testing</h6>

<p class="card-text">Before we began actual testing with the digital tablet application, we conducted several rounds of usability testing and iterated after receiving feedback. </p>

<p class="card-text">I first conducted pre-pilot heuristic evaluation on Co-Op tablet app to gauge and improve usability. </p>

<p class="card-text">Thereafter, I conducted prototype testing with 2 recruited participants for one week each to improve Co-Op tablet app usability features and gain user behavior insights. I then gathered this feedback and offered suggestions.</p>

<p class="card-text">Afterwards, I recruited and screened one subject for Co-Op remote unmoderated usability testing. I participated in user recruitment and on-boarding with subject and subject parent, collected and analyzed user data, and participated in user debriefing at subject's residency.</p>

<p class="card-text">I also participated in later rounds of user recruitment, user testing, and data analysis.</p>

<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">10. Reflection</h5>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Next Steps</h6>

<p class="card-text">We are currently testing the working prototype with actual patients and parents at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA)! We expect to further revise the application after an addition round of testing and interviews. </p>

<p class="card-text">I am hoping to redesign the tablet app as a mobile phone app, since many patients described the unwieldiness of the tablet devices.</p>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Working with Data</h6>

<p class="card-text">After reading and gleaning through multiple sets of data, I learned the value of qualitative and quantitative data. Surely, using Braun and Clarke's method helped me to structure my approach to analyzing these sets of data and consequently enabled me to earn a robust and holistic understanding of Co-op data and interviews.</p>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Empathy</h6>

<p class="card-text">Working with real patients in a co-design study, I learned the value of empathizing with the user not only for the purposes of gauging usability, but also understanding user needs and goals. Sometimes, it was easy to make assumptions, but talking with real people helped to ground and inform design decisions.</p>
