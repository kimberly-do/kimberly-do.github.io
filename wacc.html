                <p class="card-text">Georgia Tech's College of Computing offers one organization that solely celebrates and promotes women in computing: Women at the College of Computing (W@CC). As W@CC Webmaster, I was responsible for designing and developing the latest W@CC site.</p>

<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">1. Overview</h5>

<p class="card-text"><b>Duration:</b> 2 weeks, Winter 2019</p>

<p class="card-text"><b>Affiliations:</b>  Women at the College of Computing (W@CC), Georgia Tech</p>

<p class="card-text"><b>Collaborators: N/A</b></p>

<p class="card-text"><b>Role:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Conducting initial research and drawing insights</li>
<li>Outlining functional requirements</li>
<li>Creating user flows, wireframes, and prototypes</li>
<li>Developing a responsive website</li>
</ol>

<p class="card-text"><b>Problem Statement:</b> W@CC's old leadership left behind a defunct website that was unprofessional and uninformative. W@CC needed a new website to improve club enrollment and house general club information.</p>

<p class="card-text"><b>Key Skills:</b> Surveying, User Stories, Sketching, Workflows, Wireframes</p>

<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">2. Research</h5>

<p class="card-text">Although W@CC leadership offered me a minimal outline of necessary website requirements, I additionally consulted the results of competitive analysis and conducted surveys to better understand the primary purposes of our club website.</p>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Competitive Analysis</h6>

<p class="card-text">To better understand the role of our club website, I reviewed similar Georgia Tech organization websites aimed at minorities in technology; those sites included the following: Society of Women Engineers (SWE), Women in Engineering (WiE), Women in Physics, Women in Chemistry, and Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering (WECE).</p>

<p class="card-text">I reviewed all five organization websites for similarities across 16 observed features. Most organization websites offered information about the organization and its current leadership, but did not include information about their alumni. All organizations also featured sections that displayed current events calendar and additional resources for members. Several organizations hosted picture galleries, newsletter information, and picture galleries. Only one organization (WECE) incorporated an events archive.</p>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Surveying</h6>

<p class="card-text">To better understand the role and value of club websites (without my own bias as a club official), I released a survey about how students use current club websites. I would later use the information gathered through this survey to inform what elements to include in the website. I **released a qualitative/quantitative survey to Georgia Tech students between the ages of 17-19** and actively participating in technical clubs. The following are a few questions that were asked in the survey:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why do you join clubs/student organizations?</li>
<li>What is most critical to your attendance of a club meeting? Feel free to choose as many options as you wish.</li>
<li>What is most critical to your joining a club? Feel free to choose as many options as you wish.</li>
</ol>
<p class="card-text">In addition to receiving critical feedback from my two other officers and five additional respondents, I gained valuable insights as to what to include in the new W@CC site.</p>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Survey Results</h6>

<p class="card-text">I reviewed all the responses to my survey and found surprising results. A majority of people noted that they join clubs because of either <b>"academic/professional career [development]" or "[something] fun and in line with [their] passions"</b>. Consequently, I made sure to include elements that would showcase the developmental and entertaining aspects of W@CC. Moreover, all participants noted that, above knowing the lengths of meetings before attendance, they were interested in **knowing when meetings began, what <b>topics</b> were to be discussed, and <b>what day any meetings will be held</b>. Additionally, a majority of respondents continued to note that they were interested in a club's <b>history for holding fun and interesting events</b> in addition to career-value. Other factors such as food, companies, or swag offered were out of the question for most respondents.</p>

<p class="card-text">Aside from noting what information about club meetings were important to respondents, <b>respondents also stated the importance of club websites to their attendance</b>. A majority of respondents noted that organization websites help them "see what the club is all about" or "see if the club is active or not". One respondent was particularly enthusiastic about including "PICTURES!!!!" from past meetings, while another more subtly suggested this desire. This feedback translated into a need to incorporate an events archive.</p>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Main Findings</h6>
<ol>
<li><b>Exploration:</b> Organization websites allow students to explore clubs before joining</li>
<li><b>Information:</b> Student members look for meeting information on org sites</li>
<li><b>Reflection:</b> Archival or news posts allow students to learn about club culture or to catch-up on skipped meetings</li>
</ol>
<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">3. User Exploration</h5>

[User Groups](https://www.notion.so/df6b8c6287bb432d826e72610f7c1648)

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">User Flow</h6>

<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">4. Wireframing</h5>

<p class="card-text">I used the conducted surveys, competitive analysis, and identified user groups to define what information should be published on the W@CC website; this info included the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leadership about</li>
<li>Organization about</li>
<li>Events + Picture Archive</li>
<li>Join Us — Club Info Page aimed at first-years</li>
<li>Resources page</li>
<li>Contact info — with link to newsletter and info for sponsors</li>
<li>Weekly meeting info</li>
</ol>
<p class="card-text">Using this info, I sketched the following wireframes.</p>

<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">5. Feedback and Iterating</h5>

<p class="card-text">After creating my initial wireframes and outlining the main site content, I returned to the W@CC leadership to get feedback on my work. Although they agreed with most of my insights, they argued to remove several features due to logistical issues. </p>

<ol>
<li>Because W@CC has no membership dues and "membership-based" system, the leadership found it unnecessary to include a page to explain this membership-system in a "Join Us". Moreover, because a startlingly large number of members learn about W@CC through Georgia Tech's club fair, leadership found it unnecessary to communicate those details.</li>
<li>Because all sponsors must communicate with Georgia Tech's College of Computing, rather than the clubs themselves, leadership asked me to remove the sponsorship info page</li>
<li>Because W@CC was in its infancy with brand new leadership, no resources page was curated. Leadership asked me to remove this page until those resources were officially gathered and formatted.</li>
</ol>

<p class="card-text">Given the W@CC leadership feedback, I made several adjustments to the main content of the site.</p>
<ol>
<li>Leadership about</li>
<li>Organization about</li>
<li>Events + Picture Archive</li>
<li>~~Join Us — Club Info Page aimed at first-years~~</li>
<li>Resources page</li>
<li>Contact info — with link to newsletter ~~and info for sponsors~~</li>
<li>Weekly meeting info</li>
</ol>
<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">6. High Fidelity Prototyping & Development</h5>

<p class="card-text">While creating the W@CC website, I focused on **usability** and **simplicity**. Because the main purpose of the site was to offer information (as opposed to advertising the organization), I did not want to flood the website with details that would crowd out the most critical club-related info.</p>

<p class="card-text">I then developed a high-fidelity prototype with which I used to gain leadership feedback once more and then used to base the later development of the W@CC site.</p>

<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">7. Usability Testing</h5>

<p class="card-text">Currently, the W@CC website is not yet completed. New leadership decided to rebrand the W@CC organization, and thus demanded a new W@CC website, halting current site production. Nonetheless, as the semester came to a conclusion, I took this as an opportunity to release a survey to existing W@CC members about website usage. Although I have not received all the desired feedback yet, I look forward to using this information to inspire the next iteration of the W@CC website. I moreover anticipate obtaining feedback from leadership again, but additionally conducting interviews to further gauge website usability.</p>

<h5 class="card-title" id="highlight">8. Reflection</h5>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Informing Designs with Data</h6>

<p class="card-text">Conducting surveys, using competitive analysis, and obtaining constant feedback allowed me to utilize key user insights when deciding how to design the site. I found that relying on real data and not falling back on my own assumptions enabled me to create a site that better fulfilled user needs.</p>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Translating Designs to Reality**</h6>

<p class="card-text">As both the UX designer and developer of this project, I gained an entirely new perspective about how designs are transformed into a living website. While creating the designs for the site, I also deeply considered technical constraints and time constraints. Questions regarding feasibility frequently came into mind.</p>

<h6 class="card-title" id="highlight">Next Steps**</h6>

<p class="card-text">I intend to perform several more rounds of user research and usability testing to understand how well the W@CC website performed this semester. I also intend to revise the website so that it aligns with new branding guidelines.</p>
